    "# 07 — Marketing Report: Channel Performance & Budget Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) uses statistical inference to estimate how much each marketing channel contributes to sales, accounting for lagged effects, diminishing returns, and external factors like promotions and customer satisfaction. This report summarises the model's findings for the DT Mart dataset (Jul 2015 – Jun 2016) across four channels: TV, Sponsorship, Digital, and Online.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this report covers:** spend allocation versus contribution to GMV, how long campaigns keep working after they end, where diminishing returns are already visible, and a directional view of where rebalancing the budget could improve returns.\n",

    "> **Data note:** This dataset covers one year of weekly data with monthly media spend distributed uniformly across weeks. Model estimates are directional. Treat channel rankings as guidance, not precise measurements."

    "\n",
    "- Sponsorship is the single largest driver of media spend at 46.6% of total budget, and the model confirms it is also the largest channel contributor to GMV in absolute terms — but spend share and contribution share may not be proportional.\n",
    "- Digital and Online channels together account for 47.8% of spend and a significant share of modelled channel GMV, with different saturation and carryover profiles that suggest different roles in the media mix.\n",
    "- TV is the smallest channel by spend (5.6%) but shows measurable contribution and potentially favourable marginal returns at its current spend level.\n",
    "- The model's ability to reproduce observed weekly GMV (see the posterior predictive check in notebook 04) confirms that the channel structure and control variables are capturing the main drivers of sales variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What the model suggests (directional):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- TV shows a meaningful carryover effect relative to its spend level — campaigns may continue working for several weeks after they end, which is relevant for budget timing decisions.\n",
    "- Sponsorship, as the highest-spend channel, may be approaching or entering the flatter part of its response curve — the next incremental rupee spent here may generate less GMV than the same rupee in a less saturated channel.\n",
    "- The marginal return analysis suggests rebalancing some budget away from the most-saturated channel(s) towards channels still in the steep portion of their curves could improve total GMV without increasing overall spend.\n",
    "- The contribution share vs spend share gap for one or more channels suggests the current allocation was not optimised on response-curve data — historical spend levels may reflect brand priorities or partnerships rather than marginal efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we need to verify before acting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collect at least two full years of weekly data (104+ observations) to give the model enough signal to reliably separate channel effects from seasonal patterns and one-off events.\n",
    "- Validate model predictions on held-out months (e.g., fit on 10 months, predict the last 2) before trusting the response curves for budget decisions.\n",
    "- Obtain daily-level media spend data if possible — pro-rata distributing monthly spend across weeks means all weeks in a month look identical to the model, limiting within-month attribution.\n",
    "- Review the saturation and carryover estimates with the media buying team — the model's priors encode generic industry assumptions, and local market knowledge should inform whether those assumptions are appropriate for DT Mart."
